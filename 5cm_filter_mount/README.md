# 5cm Filter Holder

This project is geared to mount some 5x5cm glss filters to my Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super film camera in an easily removable way. The direction taken was to make a simple slot that can be fixed to an appropriately chosen expander ring.

The camera has a 27mm internaly threaded lens, the most easily available expanders on Amazon were some 27mm - 37mm expander rings [1]. This project has gone through several iterations. Model created using Shapr3D [2] for the iPad Air.

V1.0 - Quick mockup, sized too small for the glass filter.
V1.1 - Worked very well for the 715nm LP filter, though had to be affixed using UHU tac to the camera as the mounting diameter was too small and I hadn't yet recieved the expander.
V1.2 - Larger version of V2 to fit the 720nm filter after I broke my 715nm ):
V1.3 - Changes to mounting diameters to fit the delivered expander ring.
